Final_project.py can be run directly without any prior step.

Spell_checker GUI.py on the other hand need to change the directory first on line 22.

Both of these files have the same objective.

- The first one had the database in its code and the second one had to import the dictionary.
- The usage of tkinter to apply the GUI in Spell_checker GUI.py .
