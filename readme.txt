Spell_checker.py can be run directly without any prior step.

Spell_checker GUI.py on the other hand need to change the directory first on line 22.

Both of these files have the same objective.
The only differences are:
- The first one had the dictionary in its code and the second one had to import the dictionary file.
- The usage of tkinter to apply the GUI in Spell_checker GUI.py .
